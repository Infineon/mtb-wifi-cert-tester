# Wi-Fi Cert Tester tool for ModusToolbox SDK

The Wi-Fi Cert Tester tool is used for Wi-Fi certification of 802.11n-PSK, WPA2 Enterprise security, PMF, 802.11ac, WPA3 and WPA3-R3(Personal).

This tool uses the command console asset to initialize and invoke the wifi-cert middleware init function.

The tool accepts commands from the UCC Test Agent on a serial terminal (UART interface), executes the UCC test commands, and responds to the UCC Test Agent by sending the response in the serial console.

Wi-Fi certification using the tool needs knowledge of the Wi-Fi Alliance test beds and associated software tools and hardware. Instructions in this document conform to the certification requirements of the Wi-Fi Alliance organization.

## Throughput improvements

The following changes are done to improve the throughput

- Disable UDP Tx and UDP Rx checksum in lwipopts.h

- Optimize MEMCPY by copying 4bytes size for GCC Compiler

- Increase the CPU clock speed from 144Mhz to 150Mhz

The other improvements done in ModusToolbox SDK 

- Automatically select SDIO UHS-1 mode.


## Other improvements recommended

- Moving critical sections of Tx and Rx data path into RAM from FLASH

- The above changes depend on the size of the applicaton and available RAM

## Test setup

### Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

### Wi-Fi Cert Test bed setup

**Figure 1. Simplified Wi-Fi Cert Test bed**

![](images/simplified-wifi-cert-test-bed.png)

Component | Function
----------|---------
Test AP | Configured per test pre-requisites
DUT Control Agent | A Linux PC connected the PSoC 6 kit (DUT) <br> (see [Supported kits](#supported-kits))
UCC Linux PC | Triggers the test to be run and sends the test commands to the DUT. The Control Agent PC and the DUT Control Agent PC relay the command to the PSoC 6 kit.
PSoC 6 kit | DUT running the Wi-Fi cert tester tool

<br>

### Software setup

This tool requires a serial terminal such as Tera Term, PuTTY, or MiniCom to observe the output. The Wi-Fi Cert Test bed uses Python scripts to take control of the terminal.

### Code checkout and build

Open a serial terminal. On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the "modus-shell" app from the Start menu.

1. Run the following command to clone the repo and get all the assets:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-wifi-cert-tester

   cd mtb-wifi-cert-tester

   make getlibs
   ```

2. Run the following command to build and program:

   ```
   make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
   ```

## Operation

1. Copy the *../mtb_shared/wifi-cert/latest-v4.X/scripts*  folder into the DUT Control Agent PC.

2. Open the *init_dut_ca.sh* file and locate the following line:

   ```
   sudo modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0xa5c product=0x43fa
   ```
3. Update the line with correct vendor and product ID for the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU kit. You can get this information using the `dmesg` command after connecting the kit to the PC via the USB cable.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Run the shell script and make sure that the FTDI driver is displayed with *tty/ACM*:

   ```
   ./scripts/init_dut_ca.sh
   ```

6. Set the following on the terminal application:

   - Set the serial port to `/dev/ttyACM0`.

   - Set the baud rate as 115200 and turn off hardware flow control.

7. Run the following script:

   ```
   ./dut_ca.py -t /dev/ttyACM$x
   ```

	'x' can be 0 to ..n.

	Now the Kit is ready for commands from the UCC Test Agent. The UCC PC runs the test as a batch command (i.e., series of tests) or individual tests. The test script configures the Test AP per the pre-requisites, and then runs the actual tests. Test results are collected in the UCC PC under the */logs* folder for the particular test.

8. Type `list` on the console to get the list of Wi-Fi Cert test tool commands:

   ```
   0. sta_get_ip_config

   1. sta_set_ip_config

   2. sta_get_info

   3. sta_get_mac_address

   4. sta_is_connected
